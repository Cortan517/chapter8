# Creating an App’s Navigation
In this chapter, I learned how to implement effective navigation in a mobile application using Flutter's powerful widgets. For instance, I can use the Navigator widget to navigate between pages, while Hero animations can make transitions visually appealing by seamlessly moving a widget from one page to another. I also explored how to create a horizontal list of items with BottomNavigationBar and enhance it using BottomAppBar for a stylish notch effect. Moreover, I learned to build tab-based navigation with TabBar and TabBarView, and implement a Drawer for sliding menus with a customizable ListView for menu items. This chapter emphasized the importance of creating intuitive navigation for a smooth user experience. For example, allowing users to add a new tag while writing a journal entry—without navigating away and breaking their workflow—ensures minimal taps and maximizes convenience.
